# Unity Kart Particles
I added three particle effects. Red glowing sparks that emit from the ground because you're going fast :^)
I also added a nasty green particle emitter from the player model to simulate flatulence. I'm not sure why I did that.
Lastly' I thought it would be fun to add ramps and then remove the players kart so they just have a floating player instead.

# Three.js custom
For my own custom particle animation I decided to mimic an old windows screensaver effect, 
The Starfield simulation with a few extra's courtesy of part A.
